# pylit

Pylit is a program that receives a text file as input and will output any detected alliterations on a line-by line-basis.  An alliteration is a literary device where a sequence of words start with the same letter or sound.  For example:

$cat alliteration.txt
What a wonderful world!
Whispered words of wisdom
The wind was whistling through the weeping willows

$python main.py alliteration.txt
wonderful world
whispered words
wind was whistling through the weeping willows
